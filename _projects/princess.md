In this project, we develop methods for learning the operations of the existing devices in a system, recognizing the need to adapt due to changes in the operation of a device, and automatically adapting to new devices. Models will be built using machine learning techniques to recognize and distinguish between various data types and automatic service composition techniques to adapt new devices to support existing functionality and to take advantage of new performance capabilities and features.
