I like playing video games and board games in my free time. I played mostly strategic-thinking games and sometimes I got a little bit competitive in the games. Some achievements in my amateur game career:
- Leaderboard Top 3 in Teotihuacan Game on [Boardgamearena](http://boardgamearena.com/). 
- Quarter finalist in Hearthstone (https://playhearthstone.com/en-us) Legends Tournament in Southeast Asia. 

Besides playing games, I also love hiking and roadtripping.
