I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Computer Science Department at University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles. I am working as a research assistant at the [Center of Knowledge Graphs](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/home/), advised by Prof. [Craig Knoblock](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/knoblock/). My research focuses on machine learning and AI techniques to reduce human effort in data integration. Particularly, I have been working on unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches for error detection and data cleaning.

I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](http://cse.hcmut.edu.vn/). My undergraduate research advisor is Prof. [Tru Hoang Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=L6B67EAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). After undergraduate, I worked at [John Von Neumann Institute](http://www.jvn.edu.vn/) as a research assistant for a year. I was also a part-time instructor and teaching assistant at [Ho Chi Minh University of Technology](https://www.hcmut.edu.vn/en) and [Ton Duc Thang University](https://www.tdtu.edu.vn/en/home).
