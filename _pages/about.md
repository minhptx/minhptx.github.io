I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles. I am working as a research assistant at the [Center of Knowledge Graphs](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/home/), advised by [Prof. Craig Knoblock](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/knoblock/). My research focuses on data integration problems and how to use machine learning and AI techniques to solve these problems. In summer 2018, I worked as an research intern at [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/index.html) where we applied [Probabilistic Soft Logic](https://psl.linqs.org/) (PSL) on solving entity resolution/linking problem. 

Prior to joining USC, I worked at [John Von Neumann Institute](http://www.jvn.edu.vn/) (2014) as a research assistant and was a part-time instructor/teaching assistant at [Ho Chi Minh University of Technology](https://www.hcmut.edu.vn/en) and [Ton Duc Thang University](https://www.tdtu.edu.vn/en/home).

========

Semantic labeling: A domain-independent approach
-----------------
Worked on a machine learning approach to develop a domain-independent system for mapping data attributes/columns to domain ontologies.
