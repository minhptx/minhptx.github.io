## Abstract
Semantic labeling is the process of mapping attributes in
data sources to classes in an ontology and is a necessary step in hetero-
geneous data integration. Variations in data formats, attribute names
and even ranges of values of data make this a very challenging task. In
this paper, we present a novel domain-independent approach to auto-
matic semantic labeling that uses machine learning techniques. Previous
approaches use machine learning to learn a model that extracts features
related to the data of a domain, which requires the model to be re-trained
for every new domain. Our solution uses similarity metrics as features to
compare against labeled domain data and learns a matching function to
infer the correct semantic labels for data. Since our approach depends
on the learned similarity metrics but not the data itself, it is domain-
independent and only needs to be trained once to work eectively across
multiple domains. In our evaluation, our approach achieves higher accu-
racy than other approaches, even when the learned models are trained
on domains other than the test domain.
